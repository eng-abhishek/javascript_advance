// include_once() or include allows a file to be included, and in cases where the file is missing or has the wrong name, we receive an error message and execution will still continue regardless.

// On the other hand, require_once() or require would be suitable in cases where a file needs to be included once and if it is missing or has a wrong name then we receive a fatal error and the execution of the program stops.

// require_once or require is a suitable method in cases where a database connection file is involved and helps alleviate the possibility of multiple instances of the same file being included several times.
